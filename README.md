## Tech Stack

This project is composed by a front end SPA and a REST API server. The entire stack uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the programming language, in order to provide type-safety, IDE intellisense autocompletion and some other features to promote a better developer experience.  
Furthermore, this is our tech stack:

 - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
 - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
 - [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
 - [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
 - [Zodios](https://www.zodios.org/)
 - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

The projects API definitions. Establishes an interface between the front and back end of the application.

### Development

To run the entire application (front-end, back-end and database): `docker compose up front`  
This command will create a new postgreSQL database using .env variables to set up password, username and database name, and then start the REST API and front end servers.

To run only the back end: `docker compose up api`  
This command will create a new postgreSQL database using .env variables to set up password, username and database name. Also runs all migrations and seeds scripts (./packages/store/db/migrations), and finally starts api.

To run only database: `docker compose up db`  
This command will create a new postgreSQL database using .env variables to set up password, username and database name.
