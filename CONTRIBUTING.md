<h1>ü§ù Contributing </h1>

<p>Hello! We would be very happy to have new contributors to make Briefly Planning Poker even better! 
    This guide will help you to understand how we work and a few rules about the project
</p>

<h2> :earth_americas: Language </h2>
<p> As you can see, all the project (functions, comments, files and folders name and commands) and repository (branches, pull requests, issues,
docs and commits) are in english. </p>

<h2> :wink: Commits </h2>
<p>
  All commits are written using <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/">gitmoji</a> guide
</p>

<h2> :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Pull requests </h2>
<p>
  The repository doesn't allow merging directly at main/master, thus first you'll need to develop at your new local branch and create a pull request which
  must be reviewed by at least one admin member from organization team and can't have any unresolved conversation.
</p>

<h2> :white_check_mark: Issues </h2>
<p>
  We recommend that everything be registered as an issue, so that any contributors can start working on it.
</p>

<h2> :test_tube: Tests </h2>
<p>
  Currently the project has tests only at Store library (coverage always above 80%), but we're working on add all remaining tests.
</p>

<h2> :rocket: CI/CD </h2>
<p>
  For now the repository doesnt have any continuous integration flow, we're working on enabled GitHub Actions to run all the tests. However there's a Heroku App production set up, so after merging a new feature we can do the deploy by using admin Heroku account.
</p>
